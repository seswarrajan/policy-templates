  description:
    tldr: Deny deployment of privileged pods across the cluster
    detailed: This policy denies the deployment of privileged pods across the cluster to enforce security best practices and prevent privilege escalation risks. The kube-system namespace is excluded from this policy to avoid disruption of critical system components such as CoreDNS, Kube Proxy, and other essential Kubernetes services that may require privileged access.
